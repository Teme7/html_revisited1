HTML lesson by Jared Neilsen

So, this's the first of many web apps I intend to develop launching off Jared Nielsen's lecture notes/videos. A vanilla HTML doc, I've a giphy on the page, a website link, a link that opens in a different tab, and a placeholder link to refresh the page. In addition, I also tried to play with creating a table as a bonus.
